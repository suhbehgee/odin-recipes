    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Hollondaise:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Eggs Benedict:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>8 thin slices smoked ham</li>
        <li>1/2 fresh spinach</li>
        <li>4 medium english muffines, split</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Hollandaise: Whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, and pepper 
            in a pan over low heat. Add 1/2 of the butter and continue to whisk until 
            the butter is melted and incorporated. Add remaining butter and salt and 
            whisk until melted. Sprinkle in paprika. Turn heat off and cover with a 
            lid to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with 5 to 8 inches of water and bring to a gentle 
            simmer. Add vinegar and reduce heat to low. Carefully break eggs into the 
            simmering water and cook until whites are firm and the yolks have thickened 
            but are not hard, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a 
            slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place 
            onto a warm plate.</li>
        <li>While the eggs are poaching heat ham in a skillet over medium-high heat 
            until warm, 2 to 3 minutes, microwave spinach sprinkled with a little water 
            on a plate for 30 seconds, and toast English muffins.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on toasted muffins. Top each half with a slice of ham, some 
            spinach, and a poached egg. Drizzle with a healthy helping of Hollandaise 
            and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
