    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These grilled chicken wings are slow-grilled and slathered in a classic 
        Buffalo chicken wing sauce. Make plenty because everyone will want seconds!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Make the Buffalo Sauce:</h4>
            <p>Mix all of the ingredients together in a small pot set over low heat and 
                stir constantly until the butter melts. Do not let it boil. Once the 
                butter melts, whisk the sauce vigorously off the heat and set aside. It 
                should remain liquid throughout the cooking process. If it starts to 
                solidify, heat it up just enough to melt it, whisking all the time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cut the wings into parts:</h4>
            <p>If you have whole chicken wings, you'll want to cut them into parts. Using 
                a sturdy chef's knife or poultry shears, cut off the wing tips and either 
                discard or reserve (we usually freeze) for making chicken stock. Then use 
                your knife or shears to separate the drumettes from the flats 
                (the mid-joint wings).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Heat the grill:</h4>
            <p>Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for low, indirect cooking. 250°F is a good 
                temperature to shoot for, although even as high as 300°F will work. The 
                goal is to slowly grill the wings and let some of the fat render out.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Grill the wings:</h4>
            <p>Toss the wings with the vegetable oil and the salt, and arrange in one 
                layer on the grill set over indirect low heat. If you are using charcoal 
                or wood, it will be very difficult to do this, so set your fire on one 
                side of the grill and arrange the wings on the other side, away from the 
                direct heat. You want them to cook slowly, with little or no sizzle. Cover 
                the grill and cook like this for 30 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Baste the wings and continue grilling:</h4>
            <p>Turn the wings and paint with the Buffalo wing sauce. Close the grill and 
                cook for another 30 minutes. Repeat the process, until the wings are done 
                to your liking, this time painting the wings every 15 minutes or so. Make 
                sure you have a little leftover sauce to toss the wings with at the end.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve:</h4>
            <p>Toss the chicken wings in the leftover sauce and transfer to a serving 
                platter. Server immediately wihle warm.
            </p>
